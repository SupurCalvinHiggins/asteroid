## Becoming a Collaborator

This is an open source project and we are always looking for and rely on motivated collaborators to take our project to the next level.  In order to
become a collaborator you have to submit three distinct and successful pull requests.  As a collaborator you will have developer access to the 
repository and will become a member of our Slack channel where in-depth feature discussions take place and long-term strategies are being discussed.
