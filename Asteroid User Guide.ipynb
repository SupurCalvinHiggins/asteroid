    "In this document we describe the major features of Asteroid and give plenty of examples.  For the most part Asteroid should appear very familiar.  However, there are some features which differ drastically from other programming languages.  Here are just two:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All statements that look like assignments are actually pattern-match statements.  For example if I state,\n",
    "```\n",
    "let [x,2,y] = [1,2,3].\n",
    "```\n",
    "that means the subject term `[1,2,3]` is matched to the pattern `[x,2,y]` and `x` and `y` are bound to the values 1 and 3, respectively.  By the way, there is nothing wrong with this statement,\n",
    "```\n",
    "let [1,2,3] = [1,2,3].\n",
    "```\n",
    "which is just another pattern match without any variable instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Asteroid allows for list slicing.  Consider the example,\n",
    "```\n",
    "let a = [1,2,3].\n",
    "let b = a @1. -- access element 1\n",
    "println b.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The result of executing this program would be that the value `2` is printed to the screen.  On the other hand the program,\n",
    "```\n",
    "let a = [1,2,3].\n",
    "let b = a @[1]. -- access element 1 and return it in a list\n",
    "println b.\n",
    "```\n",
    "would print the value `[2]`.  We can take advantage of this capability to reverse the list `a` with a simple indexing operation using a list of indexes,\n",

    "As with most languages we are familiar with Asteroid has **variables** (alpha-numeric symbols starting with an alpha character) and **constants**.  Constants are available for all the **primitive data types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `integer`\n",
    "* `real`\n",
    "* `string`\n",
    "* `boolean`\n",
    "\n",
    "Asteroid arranges these data types in a **type hierarchy** in order to facilitate automatic type promotion:\n",
    "\n",
    "`boolean` < `integer` < `real` < `string`\n",
    "\n",
    "Asteroid supports two more data types: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `list`\n",
    "* `tuple`\n",
    "\n",
    "These are **structured data types** in that they can contain entities of other data types. Both of these data types have the probably familiar constructors which are possibly empty squence of comma separated values enclosed by square brackets for lists and enclosed by parentheses for tuples. For tuples we have the caveat that the 1-tuple is represented by a value followed by a comma to distinguish it from parenthesized expressions, e.g.`(<something>,)`. Furthermore, the null-tuple `()` actually belongs to a different data type as we will see below.\n",
    "Here are some examples,\n",
    "```\n",
    "let a = [1,2,3].  -- this is a list\n",
    "let c = (1,2,3).  -- this is a tuple\n",
    "```\n",
    "In order to distinguish it from a parenthesized value the single element in a 1-tuple has to be followed by a comma, like so,\n",
    "```\n",
    "let one_tuple = (1,).  -- this is a 1-tuple\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lists and tuples themselves are also embedded in type hierarchies, although very simple ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `list` < `string`\n",
    "* `tuple` < `string`\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, any list or tuple can be viewed as a string.  This is very convenient for printing lists and tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Asteroid supports one more type, namely the `none` type.  The `none` type has a constant named conveniently `none`.  As mentioned above, the null-tuple is of this type and therefore the constant `()` can often be used as a convenient short hand for the constant `none`.  The `none` data type does not belong to any type hierarchy."

    "Asteroid supports pattern matching on function arguments in the style of ML and many other functional programming languages.\n",
    "    Below is the quick sort implemented in Asteroid as an example of this classic style pattern matching.  What is perhaps new is the `head-tail` operator being used in the last `orwith` clause.  Here the variable `pivot` matches the first element of the list and the variable `rest` matches the remaining list which is the original list with its first element removed.  We can  also see that the `+` operator symbols are overloaded operators in the standard model to act as a list concatenation operators in addition to arithmetic operators. What you also will notice is that function calls do not necessarily have to involve parentheses.  Function application is also expressed by simple juxtaposition in Asteroid.  For example, if `foobar` is a function then `foobar(a)` is a function call in Asteroid but so is `foobar a`.  The latter form of function call is used in the last line of the function `qsort` below."

In the program below we associate our pattern with the variable `dog`. The quote at the beginning of the pattern is necessary otherwise Asteroid will try to dereference the variable `name` as well as the anonymous variables `_`. We use the pattern associated with `dog` in the `for` loop in order to filter the objects on the list. The `*` operator is necessary in order to tell Asteroid to use the pattern associated with the variable `dog` rather than using the variable itself as a pattern."

The program below illustrates that we can also pass patterns to functions where they can be used for pattern matching.  Here we define a function `match` that expects a subject term and a pattern.  It proceeds to pattern match the subject term to the pattern using the `is` predicate and returns whatever the predicate returns.

In the rewritten version below the pertinent Peano axioms are stored as rules in a rule table which the program will access during execution.   Our two Peano axioms appear as rules in the rule table.  Note that each rule is written as a pair where the first component is the left side of the corresponding rule and the second component is the right side of the corresponding rule.  The left sides of the rules represent the patterns that need to match the subject term and therefore it is not surprising that they are written as quoted expressions.  We also need to write the right sides of the rules as quoted expressions because we want to delay their evaluations until their corresponding patterns have matched an appropriate subject term.\n",
