The Asteroid Debugger (ADB) is a debugging platform for the Asteroid programming language. It features
program navigation, breakpoints, stack frame traversal, macros, and detailed information on pattern

There are three main pieces of documentation for ADB.

1. [The User Guide](./docs/guide.md), a general reference informational document
2. [ADB in action](./docs/in_action.md), a practical guide to using ADB and its explicit mode.
3. [The Developer's guide](./docs/dev_guide.md), a guide on the inner workings of ADB and how to develop Asteroid with ADB in mind
